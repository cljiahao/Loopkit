## What loopkit is

Standalone digital stamp-card loyalty for SG small vendors; a Merqo kit; owns
the `loopkit` schema in the shared Supabase project; reports metrics to merqo
over HTTP.

```

Domain code (schema, programs/cards/stamps, auth pages, admin) is implemented,
per the v1 scope in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-loopkit-core-design.md`
and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-loopkit-core.md`. Later work is tracked
as further specs/plans in the same `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/` dirs.

## Rules (always)

- TypeScript strict — no `any`, no `@ts-ignore`.
- Validate all user input with Zod at every boundary (forms + server actions).
- Authorization lives in **RLS policies**, not in app code. Never widen a policy
  to "fix" a query — fix the query or the session instead.
- Use the **service-role client only** in Server Actions / Route Handlers, never
  in client components. It bypasses RLS.
- No secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` are inlined at build —
  rebuild after changing them.
- `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js` versions must stay compatible
  (ssr 0.10.x ↔ supabase-js 2.10x) or every query degrades to `never`.
- All Supabase clients (`src/lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`) are
  scoped to `db: { schema: "loopkit" }` — loopkit owns that schema in the
  shared Merqo Supabase project and must never read/write another kit's schema
  (e.g. qkit's) directly. Cross-kit data goes over HTTP (the merqo metrics API),
  not a cross-schema query.
- After every new migration, regenerate `src/lib/types.ts` (`supabase gen types
typescript`) — keep the `loopkit` schema key in sync everywhere it's referenced.

## Skills

### Project skills — check here first (`.claude/skills/`)

| Skill               | What it does                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/next-verify`      | typecheck + lint + test in one pass                          |
| `/supabase-migrate` | apply `supabase/migrations` + regenerate types (safety gate) |

### templateCentral plugin skills

templateCentral has **no Supabase support** (auth=better-auth, db=Drizzle/Kysely/Mongoose,
no realtime). Use only the stack-agnostic ones here:

| Skill                       | When to use                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `templatecentral:standards` | naming/validation drift check |

Do **not** run `templatecentral:add (auth)` or `(database)` — they install
better-auth / Drizzle and will break RLS + realtime.

## AI Harness

PreToolUse: blocks secrets and CI pipeline files only (exit 2): `.env*`
(except `.env.example`), CI/CD definitions (`.github/workflows/`,
`.github/actions/`), cert files (`.pem`/`.key`/`.p12`/`.pfx`/`.secret`),
`credentials.json`/`.netrc`/`.secrets`; a second Bash guard blocks
`--no-verify`, hook-layer bypasses (`HUSKY=0`, `HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS`, `git -c
core.hooksPath=…`), and force-pushes to `main`. Skills, specs, and all app
code are unrestricted. SessionStart (startup/resume/clear/compact):
re-injects AGENTS.md routing context + `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` +
universal invariants so they survive compaction (PostCompact is
observability-only and cannot inject).
UserPromptSubmit: pattern-checks incoming prompts for injection phrases and
inline credentials; exit 2 blocks the prompt.
PostToolUse: incremental type-check (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
--incremental`) after every Edit/Write. Feedback-only.
Stop hook: runs full test suite (`pnpm test --run`); exit 2 feeds failures
to Claude via stderr; exit 0 on pass.
SubagentStop: type-gates a subagent's uncommitted TS changes before it can
hand back control.
Git hooks (husky): pre-commit runs format/lint/typecheck + gitleaks
secret-scan on staged files, plus a readme-coupling staleness warning;
commit-msg enforces Conventional Commits; pre-push runs the harness
integrity check + quality gate. Hard-local; coverage/changed-line gates
run in CI. Migrated 2026-08-01 off lefthook, whose unsigned `lefthook.exe`
Windows Smart App Control blocks unconditionally — see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-lefthook-to-husky-migration-design.md`.
CI (GitHub Actions): hard gate on changed-line coverage (`diff-cover`
≥80%), lockfile-in-sync (`--frozen-lockfile`), a changelog-touched check, a
readme-freshness check, harness integrity, and (via `security.yml`) a
full-history gitleaks scan + `pnpm audit`.

## Skills Security

- Review `SKILL.md` before installing any third-party skill — treat skills like packages.
- Scope `allowed-tools:` to the minimum (e.g. `Bash(git *)` not `Bash`).
- Never install skills that hardcode secrets or make unlisted outbound calls.

## Git Workflow

**Branch source:** Always fork from an up-to-date `main`.
Before branching: `git fetch -p` then update `main` (`git checkout main &&
git pull --ff-only`). Fork the feature FROM the freshly-pulled `main`.

loopkit is a single-branch trunk: `main` is the only long-lived branch, and
Vercel auto-deploys on every push to it. Every change lands via a
feature-branch PR into `main` — there is no `uat`/`develop` stage. The
seeded hooks protect `main` from direct commits and force-push regardless
of this route (see "AI Harness" above).

## Skill capture

- A workflow done twice → author a `.claude/skills/<name>/` project skill and commit it, so the repo (and teammates) carry it, not just session memory. `/skill-audit` surfaces repeats from `.claude/skill-usage.log`.
- Don't vendor third-party plugin skills — re-author the workflow as a project skill tuned to this repo.

## Project-Specific Notes

- This repo was seeded as a harness from the sibling project `qkit` (same
  templateCentral Supabase variant, same shared Supabase project, different
  schema). Domain code (programs/cards/stamps, auth pages, dashboard, admin)
  is implemented; v1 plan/design: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-loopkit-core.md`
  (design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-loopkit-core-design.md`).
- Later features are tracked as further specs/plans in the same
  `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/` dirs (v2 phases, workspace phases, etc.).
- **Vendor Telegram Connect / Phase A2** (2026-08-16, supersedes Phase A):
  loopkit no longer runs its own Telegram bot. Phase A (deep-link QR in
  `/dashboard/settings`, `src/lib/telegram.ts`/`telegram-link.ts`, the
  `src/app/api/telegram/webhook/` route, `loopkit.vendor_telegram`/
  `loopkit.telegram_link_tokens` from migration `0036`) was retired in
  full — those tables were dropped by migration `0037`, and every file
  above was deleted. `redeemAction`'s vendor alert
  (`notifyRedemptionOnTelegram`, `src/app/dashboard/actions.ts`) now calls
  `notifyVendor` (`src/lib/merqo-customer-notify.ts`), which posts to
  merqo's shared bot via `POST /api/merqo/notify-vendor`. A vendor who'd
  linked loopkit's own bot must reconnect once via merqo's own profile
  page — no data carried over. A missing connection or a send failure is
  caught and logged, never surfaces to `redeemAction`'s own result. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-vendor-telegram-connect-design.md`.
- **Customer Telegram connect (2026-08-16), loopkit's reuse-only half of
  the cross-kit Phase B+D design:** `redeemAction` also calls
  `notifyCustomerByPhone` (`src/lib/merqo-customer-notify.ts`) as a
  sibling to the vendor alert above, posting to merqo's
  `/api/merqo/notify-customer` endpoint in its `phone` lookup mode (never
  `notify_ref` — loopkit has no prior connect-token round to attach one
  to). This only reaches a customer who already has a **standing**
  Telegram connection with merqo from having connected via qkit _with a
  matching phone number_ — a Telegram-only qkit connection (no phone) or
  a customer who never connected at all is a silent no-op, not a bug to
  work around. No new UI, no new table, no connect flow on loopkit's side.
  `MERQO_BASE_URL`/`MERQO_CUSTOMER_SECRET` are optional; a missing value
  no-ops the same way the Telegram vars above do. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-customer-telegram-connect-design.md`.
